My main career goals are to support those human systems and provide new ways of economic and social interactions through code. </p><p>Software is a tool, not an end in itself. Software has to be simple. This aim for simplicity serves me as a guiding principle and is an extremely challenging goal to achieve. A challenge that moves me every day.</p><p>I have almost 10 years of experience with web development. The last 5 of those I've spent more focused on front-end development, but I still like and often do contribute with back-end code.</p><p>I spend my time building front-ends (web & native mobile) for <a href="https://werkspot.nl">Werkspot</a> an international marketplace for home services.</p><p>I used to be the lead front-end developer for&nbsp;<a href="https://catarse.me">Catarse</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/catarse">an open-source</a>&nbsp;crowdfunding platform.</p><p>You can find other things I've done here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/vicnicius">Github</a></li></ul><p> or reach me out at &nbsp;<a href="mailto:me@vicnicius.com">me@vicnicius.com</a></p></section><footer class="footer"><button onclick="window.scrollTo(0,0)">Back to top</button><p>2017 - This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>. </p></footer></body>
