Science heavily inspires me, and I am now pursuing ways to apply more methodological thinking to the challenges of day-to-day work. </p><p>My ultimate goal is to understand as much as possible of the big issues in and around software business, so I can, at some point, lead my own business to worldwide success.</p><p>This journey is as exciting as it is challenging and being critical to the episteme of the solutions one might find fitting at any point is essential. For this, I know I must surround myself by like-minded people, in an environment that allows for this type of exchange to happen.</p><p>I also know I have to learn a lot about software and about people, and this is what really fuels my motivation.</p><p>I spend my time building the native application for <a href="https://werkspot.nl">Werkspot</a> an international marketplace.</p><p> I also like to enjoy some time <a href="https://blocos.app">coding stuff</a> with Elm and other programming languages.</p><p>You can find me here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/vicnicius">Github</a></li></ul><p>or reach me out at vini.andrade.dev@gmail.com</p></section><footer class="footer"><button onclick="window.scrollTo(0,0)">Back to top</button><p>2017 - This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>. </p></footer></body>
