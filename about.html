Science heavily inspires me, and I am now pursuing ways to apply more methodological thinking to the challenges of day-to-day work. </p><p>My ultimate goal is to understand as much as possible of the big issues in and around software business, so I can, at some point, lead my own business to worldwide success.</p><p>This journey is as exciting as it is challenging and being critical to the episteme of the solutions one might find fitting at any point is essential. For this, I know I must surround myself by like-minded people, in an environment that allows for this type of exchange to happen.</p><p>I also know I have to learn a lot about software and about people, and this is what really fuels my motivation.</p><p>Some technical stuff I've been doing lately:</p><ul><li>React-Native: building features for my current company iOS and Android native applications;</li><li>React: building features for my current company web platform;</li><li>Elm: building my side project - <a href="https://github.com/blocosapp/blocos">Blocos;</a></li><li>Back-end things: mostly working on tasks that support my work as a front-end developer. Lately this means a lot of php code, creating and changing graphql queries and mutations;</li><li>Data analysis: Building insights to the business and the product team using RedShift and Looker.</li></ul><p>You can also find me here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/vicnicius">Github</a></li></ul><p>or reach me out at vini.andrade.dev@gmail.com</p></section><footer class="footer"><button onclick="window.scrollTo(0,0)">Back to top</button><p>2017 - This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>. </p></footer></body>
