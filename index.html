It relates a bit to what I was saying here: https://medium.com/@viniwrites/interesting-9152d307ee81
Synthetic-sugars apart, a functional approach needs a shift in the programmers mental models.

Yes, I've considered shifting the approach to React apps to more purely functional in the past, but it is an overwhelming change.
You're basically shifting your whole mental model from component-based to function-based, and this would bring a lot of implications to code.
The more I love the idea from a theoretical perspective, in practice it does seem like it could be an overwhelming task, with unclear immediate rewards.
Anyways, thanks for reading and for sharing your experience!</p><a href="https://medium.com/@viniwrites/thats-nice-to-hear-9781b08695ed?source=rss-39c4ca706d5f------2"><h3>That's nice to hear!</h3></a><p>That's nice to hear!

I'm also quite happy with JSX and React overall. Those are two invaluable tools that popularised and fuelled innovation in the development of front-end systems. My drive to write this comes from a perspective of code I have that is challenging to put in words.</p><a href="https://medium.com/@viniwrites/thanks-for-the-feedback-a6e5483ff670?source=rss-39c4ca706d5f------2"><h3>Thanks for the feedback!</h3></a><p>Thanks for the feedback!
Yeah, styled-components do make some interesting abstractions possible, indeed.</p><a href="https://medium.com/@viniwrites/thanks-for-the-feedback-a0e99a03824f?source=rss-39c4ca706d5f------2"><h3>Thanks for the feedback!</h3></a><p>Thanks for the feedback!</p><a href="https://medium.com/@viniwrites/thank-you-very-much-4e2a6821d88b?source=rss-39c4ca706d5f------2"><h3>Thank you very much!</h3></a><p>Thank you very much!</p><a href="https://medium.com/@viniwrites/it-has-a-backdrop-of-pretentiousness-for-sure-4a90e8851726?source=rss-39c4ca706d5f------2"><h3>It has a backdrop of pretentiousness, for sure.</h3></a><p>It has a backdrop of pretentiousness, for sure.

Personally I do like the fact that in the end you just have a bunch of functions everywhere. I believe interesting abstractions could emerge from the need of fulfilling the sense of separation JSX brings. But notice that my tool of choice for writing front-end code when not doing React is Elm, so I'm probably a little bit biased.
In the end it is all a matter of personal preference, as you said.</p><br><p>Get in touch: <a href="mailto:me@vicnicius.com">me@vicnicius.com</a>.</p></section></article><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-107691493-1"></script><script>window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
