    p
      | I'm a software developer with a deep interest in how human systems work. Science heavily inspires me, and I am now pursuing ways to apply more methodological thinking to the challenges of day-to-day work. 
    p
      | My ultimate goal is to understand as much as possible of the big issues in and around software business, so I can, at some point, lead my own business to worldwide success.
    p
      | This journey is as exciting as it is challenging and being critical to the episteme of the solutions one might find fitting at any point is essential. For this, I know I must surround myself by like-minded people, in an environment that allows for this type of exchange to happen.
    p
      | I also know I have to learn a lot about software and about people, and this is what really fuels my motivation.
    p
      | I spend my time building the native application for 
      a(href='https://werkspot.nl') Werkspot
      |  an international marketplace.
    p 
      | I also like to enjoy some time 
      a(href='https://github.com/blocosapp/blocos') coding stuff
      |  with Elm and other programming languages.
