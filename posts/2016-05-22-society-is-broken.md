# About graduation

On the beginning of this year I started to think more analytically to my career, to answer some basic questions about next steps. While immersed on those reflections, one big old question rose: **should I get back to academia?**.

## A little flashback

I first went to school when I was 2 years old. When I decided to quit graduation I was 22.
