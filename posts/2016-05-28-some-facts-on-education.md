# Notes on the history of our education system

While searching about education problems in our society, I did some quick annotations. The facts mentioned here are well known and widespread, but are still worth noting.  

Generally speaking, the western based it's compulsory education systems from France, which by it's way was based on the 19th century Prussian system.

The Prussian objective with it was to ***"produce more soldiers and more obedient citizens"***.


The industrialized mind-set gave the system it's final touches, applying some basic principles of industrial production to achieve large scale literacy.

Obedience, strict hierarchy, depersonalization and uniformity. Those characteristics are present in schools and industries alike.

The school system was built to fulfill the industries human resources need. Through the process, this same system carefully works to sort the average student from the brilliant ones. The former will learn it's role and tasks and will execute them endlessly while the later will be our future industrial leaders.
