    <h2>/Scoping</h2>
    <p>I have a long story of unfinished side-projects. I am always full of ideas, and as most developers, I love to learn and use new technologies. This has led me to a cycle of learning, creating, developing, but never finishing projects. Sometimes it is ok. Sometimes the project only serves a learning purpose, and it is fine to just not finish it. With my game project though, this is not true.</p>
    <p>As I have already mentioned, I want to dig into game development so I can express myself in a meaningful way using a form of expression that appeals to me. I want to explore gaming as a form of art. And as in different forms of art, to do so, I need to learn, understand and master the tools and techniques used in the craft. Last but not least, I need to develop a fluid creativity process.</p>
    <p>There are lots of tools when can think of when it comes to game development. I've spent some time researching about the issue. If this was just about making a game and delivering it to the public as soon as possible, I would definitely choose one of the mainstream game engines out there, like Unity3D, Unreal Engine 4 or Game Maker. Those tools allow you to build for a variety of platforms, and provide you with lots of out of the box features that helps you with the most common issues you would face when developing a game.</p>
    <p>But I'm still a web developer. And I know this will be a long journey, so I want to make every step count. As a result, to take the opportunity to explore other topics that interest me, I've made choices about the tools I'll be using. Those will be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Haskell</strong>, as my programming language</li>
      <li><strong>GIMP</strong>, for visual assets production</li>
      <li><strong>Audacity</strong>, for audio assets production, if needed</li>
      <li>If I need any more softwares, I will always look for the open source alternatives.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Why Haskell</h3>
    <p>When I thought about coming up with this project for the first time, I saw an opportunity to do 2 things I was really looking forward to do for a long time: building a game and learning haskell. I've started trying some haskell since we started using a project built with it on <a href="https://github.com/catarse/catarse">Catarse</a>. And from those first experiences, I felt like understanding Functional Programming and doing so inside Haskell's world made me a better programmer. It influenced the way I thought about code, even when I was coding on javascript or ruby or php. But studying Haskell can be hard, so it takes a more structured approach to it. With this project I'm starting to do it.</p>
    <h3>Why GIMP, Audacity and other open source tools</h3>
    <p>Because I believe in open source, and in it's power to change the world. And I also believe that by using open source, contributing to it and sharing related knowledge, we can make technology accessible to more people.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, art is one of the most relavant ways a culture might exist in society. Games are a new of culture expression. They are art. So we should make it's production accessible. Open source is one of the best ways to do so.</p>
    <h3>Next steps</h3>
    <p>For the next weeks, I'm planning to start learning a bit more about Haskell and game art production.</p>
