    <h2>/Introduction</h2>
    <i>13-03-2017</i>
    <p>On recent times I've been developing great interest for games. It all started when I watched <a href="http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/">Indie Game: The Movie</a>. Though I've always been a game player, before watching this documentary I never thought of making my own games. I don't know if I had this subjective perception of game development as something too hard for me or if it was just other topics of interest on the way, but the case is that I never thought of doing it.</p>
    <p>The movie basically goes through the stories of some independent game developers, showing a bit of the bakstages of building a game on your own. So I watched this movie and I felt really inspired by the stories told there. More than this! After hearing those developers talking about games, I could exponentially broader my understanding of the role game's play on our society. It was the concept of game as a form of art raising in front of my eyes. A modern form of art that embraces lots of others, and add a new dimension of interaction with it's consumer.</p>
    <p>Right after that moment, I decided I would give games a try. It would be perfect for me. A game is built of multiple dimensions of realities that allow an individual or a group to express itself creatively in a number of different ways. This is actually something amazing I was looking for! Not just because of the self expression per se. It's more then that. Building games would allow me not only to express myself creatively but to do it while still doing something I love to do, which is programming. Programming, specially as a day-to-day work, can be a kind of cold action. Though you have to use your creativity a lot to solve your problems, the result of your coding efforts, on the end of the day, is not ment to be a personal expression of your feelings about the world or something like that. It is meant to be an efficient rational solution to a determined set of problems. And there's no problem with it. I really enjoy this nature of the craft. But sometimes I just felt that I needed more. And game development would allow me more, with the plus of still having a pleasurable amount of coding going on.</p>
    <p>And that was it. From that moment I decided I would put some time on game development. As a quick starting point I've done a quick prototype of a game using technologies I know. It was a <a href="https://github.com/vicnicius/pong.git">rough clone of the classical game Pong</a>. It is not finished, but it was already fun to build it and I could slightly get a sense of the challenges of game development. And now I am really looking forward to something bigger. Something more ambitious. I want to take lot's of ideas I have on a single project, while using the opportunity to become a better developer. So I'm starting to work on my own game, and I'll document every step of this process here. Hope I can keep up with a good pace with this project, specially with so many things happening also in my personal life.</p>
