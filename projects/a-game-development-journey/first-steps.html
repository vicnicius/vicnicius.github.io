    <h2>/First Steps</h2>
    <p>I'm slowly starting to learn about things I think will be useful for this project. I've started learning Haskell properly, learning to draw properly and also started to research more about video games from a more broad antropological, social and artistic point of view. And though the journey just begun, I already have some interesting findings:</p>
    <h3>Findings</h3>
    <h4>Learning to draw</h4>
    <p>My general idea was that drawing was something strictely related to aptitude. If you are not born to do it, then you won't. If you are one of the gifted ones, art will just show everytime you have pencil and paper in hand. But it turns out that this is not true.</p>
    <p>It doesn't mean, of course, that talent does not play an important role in drawing. It does, as it does in almost any other field of knowledge I can think of. But the thing is that you can't say you can't draw if all you do is try to sketch some stick man on an old letter cover while you are on the phone. You have to create yourself a context for your talents to show up. And if they don't, with enough hard work and discipline you can still put out some pretty decent work.</p>
    <p>Obviously, there are formal approachs to learning to draw. I chose the one that seemed more robust pedagogically speaking. So right now I'm building my basics on drawing. This means that I've been spending a lot of time drawing geometrical solids on 3d spaces with different perspectives. Though I've only been doing this kind of amazingly simple stuff, I also get a lot of pleasure of doing it. It seems like moving the mindset from programming (what I usually do during work hours) to drawing allows some thoughts on my mind to flow more fluidly accross space.</p>
