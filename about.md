#Hello!

I'm Vinicius Andrade, a 28 years old developer from Brazil, where I live with two lovely kids and a beautiful wife.

I usually write **javascript** and lately I've also been really interested on **functional programming**, so sometimes I'm also writing some basic **haskell** code and a lot of **elm** too.

I love the web and I believe that we are living a revolution built by developers. I am daily thinking how I can make a bigger/better impact on this movement either by helping other developers or by building great products.

About education, I'm really curious and an avid learner but I have some strong disagreements with the ways the education system is built and how it impacts our society, which led me to quit graduation. My thoughts on the topic are extensive and can sometimes become complicated, but I'll gradually share them in a couple of posts as soon as possible.

I strongly believe in the importance of "scientific knowledge", and as such, though outside academia, I'm always trying to develop my theoretical understanding of topics I relate to. I'm also starting an effort to stop being only a consumer and become an producer of this "type of knowledge".

I'm daily writing (open-source) code to [catarse.me](https://www.catarse.me/), the first and the best crowdfunding platform in Brazil.
