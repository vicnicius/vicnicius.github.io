    <i>22-05-2016</i>
    <p>On the beginning of this year I started to think more analytically to my career, to answer some basic questions about next steps. While immersed on those reflections, one big old question rose: <strong>should I get back to academia?</strong></p>
    <h2 id="a-little-flashback">A little flashback</h2>
    <p>I first went to school when I was 2 years old. When I decided to quit graduation I was 22. At that time, after 20 long years, I wasn’t really reasoning about my choice. I only felt deeply tired, and had a strong feeling that I was wasting my time everyday.</p>
    <p>But it didn’t happened all of a sudden. The feeling was old and I remember first feeling it while I still was at highschool. But I kept going, thinking that the next year would be better. But it never got better.</p>
    <h2 id="connecting-the-dots">Connecting the dots</h2>
    <p>My decision surely was controversial and not at all it was an easy one to take. But looking back right now, it was that decision that allowed me to use my time better and to learn the things I thought that mattered the most. At the moment I became able to focus on learning things by myself with a bit more time I also became a lot more aware of what my next steps should be and how much time I needed to each of those. I could perfectly see the reasons why I was doing A and why it was important for me to be able to also do B.</p>
    <p>With feelings settle and a clear vision of what my objectives were I could finally see myself fitting the world that surrounded me, because I knew what and how I could do things. Knowing how to walk around and understanding that I could cause impact on my environment allowed me to be able to reason about what impact I wanted to cause, which ultimately is a far more socially relevant process.</p>
    <h2 id="trying-to-understand">Trying to understand</h2>
    <p>Right now, more then 5 years have gone since them and I see myself thinking about going back to academia. It’s not that much time since I was feeling the sentiments I just described, and still the thought came to my mind. Why?</p>
    <p>There isn’t just one answer to the question, but the main reason is that, right now, I’m on a knowledge search point where the things I want to learn are deeply related to the academical world. Probably driven by my studies on haskell and javascript, I see myself constantly trying to figure out and understand some concepts that I know are part of a formal education process.</p>
    <p>So, I spent a lot of time thinking about this issue and I talked to some people about it too. I really wanted to build a solid understand of the case. And I came out with some really strong points of view and beliefs that I will share here and that I hope to evolve on other texts on the future. My points is:</p>
    <p><em>The educational system is completely broken. My quest to answer my existential questions led me to studying about how our educational system was built and how it changed over time. The conclusions are long and they would need a more thorough explanation, but I will try to put it short on two points:</em></p>
    <p><em>1 - Our educational system was built to produce pattern. Producing pattern as an educational finality reduces the creation and innovation potential of a society. We can’t estimate the losses caused by this. Maybe we could already have got to mars. Maybe we could have completely eradicated poverty, diseases, environmental problems.</em></p>
    <p><em>2 - This very same educational system could not evolve together with technology. The internet era is showing us a different way to build society. A way where information is flat and equally shared across all the nodes that connect us all. Content is rich and available at anytime to be consumed on one’s own pace and taste. The notions of power are breaking and day-by-day we see disruptive initiatives reshaping how we build aspects of our lives. And though those changes are coming faster and faster, education just start to give it’s first steps on innovation. But the future of it is clear. Knowledge, and in special, scientific content, should be easily available to anyone, anywhere, without barriers, no matter what those could be. But it is still very far away from happening. Education is the final step towards complete social transformation and as such, it is the one thing that the status quo most want untouched.</em></p>
    <p>I will definitely evolve those points a lot more, and even try to draw ways of solving some of the problems I raised on my studies, but this is a resumed introduction to some of my thoughts. From those, I think it’s easy to tell that no, I wont go back to school right now, and I don’t see this happening any time soon.</p>
