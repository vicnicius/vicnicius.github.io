    <h2>/[draft] Why Functional Programming matters</h2>
    <i>03-10-2017</i>
    <p>I'm a self-taught developer and I've been working with software for almost 10 years now. During this time, I've learnt quite some stuff regarding softwares, products & companies, and how those things connect and become part of our reality.</p>
    <p>At the beginning I would mainly focus on the code itself: making it work was the objective. But with time I started to look to different places, and understand the problems from other perspectives.</p>
    <p>The construction of these mental models helped me better understand a number of different aspects of software development. One of the most important of those mental models, for me, is the comprehension of software as a pure reflect of a business. Ideally, it should be a literal translation from business to computer language.</p>
    <p>This notion of epistemologic synergy software + business elucidates some important aspects of code itself. Change is one of those aspects, and it was by analysing the idea of change from a business + software point of view that I started to firmely believe in functional programming as a really well suited software development solution to a huge number of use cases.</p>
    <p>Code should be resilient to change. A company must be able to change fast, without having to compromise it's business. The key to embodying this ability in software is modularity. Make abstracted translations of your business interchangeable in your software is key to rapid development. And this is done really well in functional programming.</p>
    <p>FP's constrain allow for pure mathematical composition of functions, a well known and proven approach to building great computations from the composition of smaller ones. In general, being closer to pure mathematics allows for safer application of (proven) abstractions, which will inevitably bring more elegance to your business translation. When working on this constrained environment, a developer can focus on the businesess solutions way better.</p>
