# Vinícius Andrade - Software Developer

## Profile

I'm Vinícius, a 31 years old software engineer with a deep interest in the consequences of code in human systems. My main career goals are to support those human systems and provide new ways of economic and social interactions through code. 

Software is a tool, not an end in itself. Software has to be simple. This aim for simplicity serves me as a guiding principle and is an extremely challenging goal to achieve. A challenge that moves me every day.

I have almost 10 years of experience with web development. The last 5 of those I've spent more focused on front-end development, but I still like and often do contribute with back-end code.

Currently, I'm living in the Netherlands.

At Werkspot I take part on a product team, where I've been wearing different hats depending on the team needs. This varies from writing front-end in react - on our new web platform, twig/php on our old web platform and react-native - on our native mobile application to heavily supporting experiment data analysis and creating new graphql queries and mutations on our php back-end application. I'm also part of specialized guilds that take care and inform the direction of our front-end technology tools.

Take care of our JS architecture, reviewing other collaborators code and taking ownership of sections of catarse.me platform across all kind of devices are part of my responsability. I was part of a technology update project, where I lead the efforts to make it a great open-source tool for our community.
