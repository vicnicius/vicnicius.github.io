# Vinícius Andrade - Software Developer

## Profile

I'm Vinícius, a 31 years old software developer with with a deep interest in how human systems work. Science heavily inspires me, and I am now pursuing ways to apply more methodological thinking to the challenges of day-to-day work.

My ultimate goal is to understand as much as possible of the big issues in and around software business, so I can, at some point, lead my own business to worldwide success.

As a software developer, I'm interested in most areas in software, but for the last ~5 years I've been working as a front-end specialist.

Currently, I'm living in the Netherlands.
