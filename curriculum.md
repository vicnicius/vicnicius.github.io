# Vinícius Andrade - Software Developer

## Profile

I'm Vinícius, a 30 years old software developer with ~10 years of work experience in web programming. I really enjoy all aspects of software development, but in the last 4 years, I've been working as a front-end specialist. I am a huge open web advocate and I feel extremely excited to build the interfaces where human/technology interaction will happen.

From a technical perspective, I like to experiment with new technology. To be able to do it properly, I do value a good understanding of the basics, so I try to always look back to software development and computer science fundamentals when evaluating new things. I am particularly interested in functional programming.

Software per se is nothing, so I always try to understand the contexts where the software I'm working on is built and used, so I can make good calls when building it. Because of the understanding of such contexts drive changes to the product, I value agility and processes that help teams achieve it.

Outside of coding, I also enjoy writing, reading, playing video games and just expending some good time with my family.

Currently, I'm living in Hilversum, Netherlands.
