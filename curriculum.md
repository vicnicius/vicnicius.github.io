Catarse is the biggest crowd funding platform in Brazil. My work at Catarse is to provide great User Experience to our users by writing and help maintaining high quality front end code. Keep track of the intended js architecture, reviewing other collaborators code and taking ownership of sections of catarse.me platform across all kind of devices are activities I do daily. I’m also part of the product team, where I take care of our product backlog, making sure the right features are prioritized.

### FREELANCER WEB DEVELOPER

Since 2009 I do freelance front end development. On the period, I’ve lived exclusively as a front end developer for two years.

From simple hotsite development to RestAPIs written in Node.js, freelancing was my main source of experience until I got to Catarse.
